# COMPENG 2DX3 â€“ Microprocessor Systems  

This repository showcases my work from **COMPENG 2DX3 (Microprocessor Systems)**, where I developed skills in **embedded programming**, **hardware interfacing**, and **technical documentation**.  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents  
- **Theme Reports** â€“ Concise technical summaries of key course topics and labs.  
- **Lab Work** â€“ Hands-on experiments with microcontrollers and peripheral devices.  
- **Final Project: 3D Room Scanner**  
  - Designed and implemented a custom scanning system using a microcontroller and sensors.  
  - Produced a **datasheet** to document device specifications.  
  - Authored a **comprehensive project report** detailing design decisions, implementation, and results.  

## ðŸ’¡ Skills Demonstrated  
- Embedded C programming and low-level hardware control.  
- System design and integration of sensors with microcontrollers.  
- Technical writing through professional reports and documentation.  
- Project development from concept to prototype.  

## ðŸš€ Highlight: 3D Room Scanner  
The final project involved creating a **3D room mapping device**. The system scanned and visualized a physical environment, demonstrating practical knowledge in:  
- Sensor integration (time-of-flight distance measurement).  
- Stepper motor control for spatial mapping.  
- Embedded software development for data acquisition and processing.
